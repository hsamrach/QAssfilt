# QAssfilt
QAssfilt is a ready-to-use genome assembly filtering pipeline that provides high-quality contigs, ensuring confidence in your downstream analyses. Qassfilt is an independent, tool-based conda environment that is highly automated and flexible, allowing users to work independently with their preferred version of each dependency tool. The user could be employed with all kinds of Illumina paired-end reads. This pipeline workflow includes [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) for trimming and assessing the quality of FASTQ files, [SPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades) as the assembler, [QUAST](https://github.com/ablab/quast) and [CheckM2](https://github.com/chklovski/CheckM2) for evaluating the quality of assembled and filtered genomes, [SeqKit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit) for filtering contigs from assembled genomes, and finally [MultiQC](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC) for generating and visualizing reports.
# Installation
## Conda installation
Before installing QAssfilt, you have to have conda installed in your terminal. If you are new to conda, I suggest following the few steps below (credited to: [Koen-vdl](https://github.com/Koen-vdl/Conda-and-Bioconda-tutorial)) :
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Install it through this script:
```
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -s
rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Activate it to see (base) in your terminal before your path:
```
source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
```
For permanent activation:
```
echo 'source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate' >> ~/.bash_profile   
```
Update to the latest version of conda:
```
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```
Now you have your conda installed and activated via miniconda3
## QAssfilt installation
Currently, QAssfilt isn't available on conda-forge, but you could install it via my channel:
```
conda create -n qassfilt_env -c samrachhan11 qassfilt -y
```
Otherwise, you could install QAssfilt through git clone also:
```
git clone https://github.com/hsamrach/QAssfilt.git
cd QAssfilt
chmod +x qassfilt.sh
qassfilt -h # to show help
```
