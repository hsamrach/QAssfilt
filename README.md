# Qassfilt
Qassfilt is a ready-to-use genome assembly filtering pipeline that provides high-quality contigs, ensuring confidence in your downstream analyses. Qassfilt is an independent, tool-based conda environment that is highly automated and flexible, allowing users to work independently with their preferred version of each dependency tool. The user could be employed with all kinds of Illumina paired-end reads. This pipeline workflow includes [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) for trimming and assessing the quality of FASTQ files, [SPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades) as the assembler, [QUAST](https://github.com/ablab/quast) and [CheckM2](https://github.com/chklovski/CheckM2) for evaluating the quality of assembled and filtered genomes, [SeqKit](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit) for filtering contigs from assembled genomes, and finally [MultiQC](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC) for generating and visualizing reports.
